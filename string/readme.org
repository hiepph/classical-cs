* Find substring
** Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
Implementation 1: refer [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXCEFAzhxGY][Back to back SWE]]
Implementation 2: refer [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings/home/week/3][Coursera]]

Time: O(n + k), with n is the length of text \amp k is the length of pattern.
** Rabin-Karp algorithm (or rolling hash algorithm)
[[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm][wiki]]

Refer Coursera's data structure hash (week3, 3-6).
