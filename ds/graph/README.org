* Graph
  Weighted directed graph implementation with adjacency matrix.

  Undirected graph is directed graph with 2-way edges.

  It requires some additional libraries:
  + Iterative DFS (not implemented): Stack
  + BFS: FIFO Queue
  + Dijsktra's algorithm: Priority Queue

* Minimum spanning Tree (MST)
  Prim algorithm (based on Dijkstra): utilizes priority tree, grow by one edge each iteration.
